## ‚ú®&ensp;Quick Explanation

1. When I reach <img alt="JohannesMilke | Sponsor" height="28px" src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/web-johannesmilke.appspot.com/o/other%2Fgithub%2Fsponsored%2Fsponsors_target.png?alt=media" /> sponsors, another half of my repositories will be released to public. 
2. If you [Request Access](https://johannesmilke.com/#/request "Request Access") and [Become A GitHub Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/JohannesMilke "Become A GitHub Sponsor") you will get **everytime directly access** to the source code & projects I release. 
3. After becoming a sponsor, you should get an **invitation via email to the private repository**, if the invite doesn't come instantly - wait some time.

## üíñ&ensp;What Is Sponsorware?

Sponsorware means that new source code projects are released publicly if a specific target is met by the community, in the meantime existing sponsors can already access these new source code projects.

Let's say the target is to reach 150 more sponsors on GitHub.
If this target is met, all the new uploaded projects are made public so that everyone in the community can access them. After this a new target will be created for all future projects.

**3 Advantages Of Sponsorware**

- The Source Code is in longterm **Open-Source & "We have Free Education"** for all the people.
- The Content Creators **don't need to create primarily Private Courses** to finance them.
- The Content Creators can **fully focus on providing free education** on open platforms such as YouTube for their community.

## üéôÔ∏è&ensp;Why Sponsorware?

I strongly believe that "Sponsorware" is the future for all Software Content Creators. Next to selling high specialized courses, Sponsorware is for us as content creators important so that we have another income stream that helps us to support the mission of free education on YouTube instead of focusing primarily on selling private courses and making knowledge & education closed for a small priviliged group of people.
I am convinced that in longterm YouTube will become a platform where you get EVERY IMAGINABLE CONTENT for free because more content creators are producing free & high quality content for a specific niche such as Flutter.

## ‚úå&ensp;How Am I Going To Use Sponsorware?

1) I set a target for the community f.e. to reach 150 new sponsors.
2) I am going to upload new Flutter projects that will be all private, however sponsors can still access all projects at every time.
3) If the target of f.e. 150 new sponsors is reached, half of my private projects will be made public.
4) Start over with 1. again
